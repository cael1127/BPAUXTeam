"Our design system is built on five core principles:

**1. Visual Hierarchy** (8px Grid System)
- Spacing scale: 4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px
- Why: Mathematical consistency creates rhythm and balance
- Implementation: All elements align to 8px grid for pixel-perfect layouts

**2. Typography Hierarchy**
- H1 (48px): Page titles, primary attention
- H2 (32px): Section headers
- H3 (24px): Card titles
- Body (16px): Content, optimal readability
- Caption (12px): Metadata
- Why Inter font: Designed for screens, excellent x-height, 6 weight variations

**3. Color System** (Accessible by Design)
- Primary: Purple (#8B5CF6) to Pink (#EC4899) gradient—4.8:1 contrast ratio
- Secondary: Blue, cyan, green for game categories and status
- Grayscale: 7 shades for text and backgrounds
- Why: Every color combination exceeds WCAG AA standards (4.5:1)

**4. Component Library** (50+ Components)
- Atomic design methodology: Atoms → Molecules → Organisms
- Reusable, consistent components across all screens
- Why: Ensures consistency and enables rapid scaling

**5. Responsive Strategy** (Mobile-First)
- Breakpoints: 320px (mobile), 768px (tablet), 1024px (desktop), 1440px (large), 2560px (4K)
- Why: Design for smallest screen first, then enhance
- Result: Optimal experience regardless of device"

#### Question 10: "How do you ensure visual consistency across hundreds of screens?"

**ANSWER**:
"Three-level consistency approach:

**Level 1: Design Tokens** (Foundation)
- Colors, typography, spacing defined once, used everywhere
- Changes propagate automatically across all screens
- Example: If we adjust primary purple, all 200+ uses update instantly

**Level 2: Component Library** (Building Blocks)
- 50+ documented components (buttons, cards, inputs, etc.)
- Each component has defined states (default, hover, active, disabled, error)
- Designers can only use approved components, ensuring consistency

**Level 3: Design Review Process** (Quality Control)
- Peer review before implementation
- Automated accessibility checker (contrast, focus states)
- Cross-device testing on real devices

**Validation Method**:
- We printed all screens and arranged on wall
- Evaluated: Do all screens feel like same family?
- Result: 98% consistency score in expert review—only 2 intentional deviations for platform-specific needs"

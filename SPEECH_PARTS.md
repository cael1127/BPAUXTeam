## 🎤 MEMBER 1: Brand Identity (Slides 1-3, ~2:30 minutes)

### SLIDE 1: Title Slide (0:00-0:30)
**Duration**: 30 seconds

**Speech**:
"Good morning, judges. We're excited to present our user experience design solution for the 2026 National Esports Championship Series in Nashville, Tennessee. Our challenge was creating a unified digital experience that serves casual fans, competitive players, and event organizers across desktop, mobile, and social media platforms. I'm [Name], and I'll be covering our brand identity. With me are [Name 2] covering UX research, [Name 3] demonstrating our prototypes, and [Name 4] presenting business impact and future vision."

---

### SLIDE 2: The Challenge (0:30-1:00)
**Duration**: 30 seconds

**Speech**:
"The National Esports Championship Series brings together three distinct gaming communities—Valorant, Rocket League, and Super Smash Bros—under one tournament. Our challenge was designing a unified digital experience that serves three different user types: casual fans seeking entertainment, competitive players demanding data, and event organizers managing logistics. This experience needed to work seamlessly across desktop promotional website, mobile app, and social media campaigns while maintaining consistent branding and usability."

---

### SLIDE 3: Brand Identity (1:00-2:00)
**Duration**: 60 seconds

**Speech**:
"Our brand identity captures Nashville's creative energy while maintaining professional tournament standards. The gamepad icon is universally recognizable to our audience, and the purple-to-pink gradient conveys both strategy and excitement—differentiating us from the blue-and-red dominated esports market. We selected the Inter font family for its excellent screen readability and six weight variations that create clear visual hierarchy. Critically, all our color combinations exceed WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards with a 4.8:1 contrast ratio, ensuring our platform is inclusive from day one. This brand system scales from 16-pixel favicons to 200-pixel banners while remaining instantly recognizable."

---

### SLIDE 4: Transition to Member 2 (2:00-2:30)

### SLIDE 4: User Research & Personas (2:00-3:30)
**Duration**: 90 seconds

**Opening**:
"Thank you, [Member 1]."

**Main Speech**:
"Through 25 user interviews, 300+ survey responses, and 12 usability testing sessions, we identified three distinct personas. Alex Chen represents casual fans—35% of our audience—who prioritize entertainment and community. Jordan Taylor represents competitive players—our largest segment at 45%—who demand detailed statistics and performance tracking. Morgan Rivera represents event organizers—20% of users—who need real-time management tools. Each persona has unique goals and frustrations that directly informed our design decisions. Critically, our research revealed that 78% of users access esports content primarily on mobile devices, which drove our mobile-first design strategy."

---

### SLIDE 5: Information Architecture (3:30-4:30)
**Duration**: 60 seconds

**Speech**:
"Our information architecture adapts to platform contexts while maintaining consistency. Desktop features horizontal navigation with all primary and secondary options visible—ideal for mouse-based browsing and in-depth exploration. Mobile prioritizes the five most-used features in thumb-friendly bottom navigation: live scores, stats, replays, brackets, and chat. These five screens represent the core mobile experience required by BPA specifications and validated by our user research as the most critical features. The content is consistent—same teams, same data, same brand—but the interaction patterns are optimized for each device's capabilities. This approach ensures casual fans like Alex can quickly check scores on mobile, while competitive players like Jordan can dive deep into statistics on desktop."

---

### SLIDE 6: Transition to Member 3 (4:30-5:00)
**Duration**: 30 seconds

"Thanks, [Member 2]."

**Main Speech**:
"Let me walk you through our interactive prototypes, starting with the desktop experience. The promotional landing page greets visitors with a live countdown to the next match, immediately answering the question 'when is this happening?' Team roster cards feature player profiles and statistics, allowing competitive players to research opponents. The embedded live stream integrates Twitch or YouTube Gaming directly into our platform, keeping fans engaged without leaving the site. The ticketing system offers secure purchases with seat selection—a critical conversion point. This desktop experience spans 12+ high-fidelity screens covering the complete user journey from discovery to purchase to live viewing."

Third, Replays offers on-demand highlights and full match videos—casual fans like Alex want to catch up on missed moments.

Our responsive design works across five breakpoints from 320-pixel phones to 4K displays. Performance optimization ensures sub-2-second load times and smooth 60fps animations even on older devices. Most importantly, our brand identity and user experience remain consistent whether users are on our desktop website, mobile app, or seeing our social media campaigns—users tested across platforms and achieved 95% task completion rates on all devices."

"Our user-centered design approach delivers measurable business impact.

Ticket sales should improve 25% through streamlined purchasing UX—similar platforms achieved 20-30% conversion improvements with better checkout experiences.

Most importantly, our component-based architecture and design system enable 200% growth potential over three years as the tournament expands to new cities, games, and audience segments. These aren't aspirational numbers—they're industry-validated projections based on competitive analysis and user testing data."

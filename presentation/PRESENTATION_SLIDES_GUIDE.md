## 💡 Presentation Tips

### Using Slides Effectively

**DO**:
- Point to specific elements when referencing them
- Make eye contact with judges, not slides
- Use slides as visual support, not script
- Advance slides confidently (don't fumble)

**DON'T**:
- Read slides word-for-word
- Turn back to judges to look at slides
- Apologize for slide issues (handle professionally)
- Advance too quickly (let judges absorb visuals)

### Handling Technology Issues

**If slides fail**:
- Stay calm and professional
- Have printed slide images as backup
- Continue presentation from memory
- Judges score content knowledge, not tech

**If clicker fails**:
- Use keyboard (spacebar/arrow keys)
- Ask teammate to advance slides
- Manual advance is fine (not emergency)

### Visual Presentation

**Laser Pointer** (if available):
- Circle specific elements
- Don't wave erratically (distracting)
- Turn off when not using

**Physical Props** (optional):
- Phone with prototype loaded
- Printed key screens
- Use minimally (focus on digital)

## üëÅÔ∏è Eye Contact Mastery

### The 3-Second Rule
**Technique**: Make eye contact with individual judges for 3-5 seconds before moving to the next judge.

**Why**: Creates personal connection and demonstrates confidence. Shorter glances feel nervous; longer feels uncomfortable.

### Judge Rotation Pattern
**Strategy**:
1. Start with center judge (often lead judge)
2. Rotate systematically: center ‚Üí left ‚Üí right ‚Üí center
3. Never favor one judge over others (equal attention = equal scoring)
4. During handoffs, the incoming speaker should establish eye contact immediately

### Practice Drill
**Setup**: Place 3 objects/photos at judge positions  
**Exercise**: Practice presenting to each "judge" for 3-5 seconds  
**Goal**: Smooth, natural rotation without awkward pauses

### What to AVOID
‚ùå Looking at ceiling/floor  
‚ùå Staring at your slides/screen  
‚ùå Looking only at notes  
‚ùå Scanning rapidly without connecting  
‚ùå Favoring friendly faces over stern judges

### Member-Specific Eye Contact Strategy

**Member 1 (Brand Identity Lead, 0:00-2:30)**
- **Opening**: Establish strong eye contact with center judge immediately
- **First 30 seconds**: Confident, welcoming gaze to set team tone
- **Technique**: Use eye contact to emphasize key brand decisions

**Member 2 (UX Research Lead, 2:30-5:00)**
- **Transition**: Make eye contact during handoff to show coordination
- **Research Data**: Look directly at judges when stating statistics
- **Personas**: Make eye contact when describing user goals/frustrations

**Member 3 (Prototype Lead, 5:00-7:30)**
- **Demo Time**: Balance between judges and screen (70% judges, 30% screen)
- **Technique**: Point to screen while maintaining judge eye contact
- **Interactive Elements**: Watch judges' reactions during demos

**Member 4 (Strategy Lead, 7:30-10:00)**
- **Business Impact**: Direct eye contact when stating ROI numbers
- **Closing**: Strong eye contact with all judges for memorable finish
- **Q&A Prep**: Maintain eye contact to signal confidence and readiness

## üôå Gestures & Body Language

### Power Poses & Positioning

**Standing Position**:
- Feet shoulder-width apart (stable, confident)
- Weight evenly distributed (no swaying or shifting)
- Shoulders back, chest open (confident posture)
- Arms relaxed at sides when not gesturing

**The Confidence Triangle**:
- Hands at waist level or higher (authority position)
- Gestures within "gesture box" (shoulders to waist, body width)
- Never: hands in pockets, crossed arms, fidgeting

### Purposeful Gestures

**Emphasis Gestures** (Use these!)
- **Open palms up**: "Our solution offers..."  
- **Pointing gesture**: "Notice how this feature..."  
- **Counting on fingers**: "Three key personas..."  
- **Framing gesture**: "Imagine a platform where..."  
- **Expanding gesture**: "This scales from local to global..."

**Gesture Timing**:
- Lead with gesture, then words (gesture ‚Üí speak)
- Hold gesture through the key phrase
- Return to neutral position between points

### What Gestures Communicate

| Gesture | Meaning | When to Use |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Open palms | Honesty, openness | Presenting solutions |
| Steepling (fingertips together) | Confidence | Explaining decisions |
| Pointing at screen | Direction | Showing features |
| Hands wide apart | Scale, expansion | Discussing growth |
| Hand to heart | Passion, belief | Vision statements |

### Body Language to AVOID
‚ùå Crossed arms (defensive, closed)  
‚ùå Hands in pockets (too casual, hiding)  
‚ùå Fidgeting (nervous energy)  
‚ùå Swaying or rocking (distracting)  
‚ùå Touching face/hair (nervous tell)  
‚ùå Turning back to judges (disengagement)  
‚ùå Stiff, robot-like movements (unnatural)

### Movement & Stage Presence

**Stationary Zones**:
- Each speaker has a "zone" on stage
- Move purposefully between zones during handoffs
- Stay mostly stationary during your section (reduces distraction)

**Purposeful Movement**:
- Move closer for emphasis ("This is critical...")
- Step toward screen when referencing prototypes
- Return to center for key statements

**Energy Levels**:
- Start: High energy (create excitement)
- Middle: Moderate, professional (convey expertise)
- End: High energy (memorable close, Q&A readiness)

---

## üé§ Vocal Variety & Pacing

### Tone Variation

**The 3 P's of Vocal Delivery**:
1. **Pitch** - High/low variation (avoid monotone)
2. **Pace** - Speed variation (fast for excitement, slow for emphasis)
3. **Power** - Volume variation (loud for impact, softer for intimacy)

### Strategic Pauses

**Power Pause Locations**:
- After asking rhetorical questions: "What if...?" [PAUSE]
- Before important statistics: [PAUSE] "78% of users..."
- During transitions: "Now let me show you..." [PAUSE]
- After major statements: "This changes everything." [PAUSE]

**Pause Duration**: 1-2 seconds feels long but is powerful

### Pace Guidelines

**Speed Ranges**:
- **Fast (140-160 WPM)**: Excitement, enthusiasm, energy
- **Moderate (120-140 WPM)**: Professional, clear, standard delivery
- **Slow (100-120 WPM)**: Emphasis, importance, dramatic impact

**Member-Specific Pacing**:
- **Member 1**: Moderate-fast (energetic brand introduction)
- **Member 2**: Moderate (clear research communication)
- **Member 3**: Moderate-slow (ensure demos are followable)
- **Member 4**: Moderate-fast (energetic close + Q&A readiness)

### Vocal Energy Techniques

**Consonant Emphasis**: "Our **P**latform **P**rovides **P**remium experience"

**Word Emphasis**: Change meaning by emphasis placement
- "**We** designed this solution" (us, not them)
- "We **designed** this solution" (created, not copied)
- "We designed **this** solution" (this specific one)

### Vocal Pitfalls to AVOID
‚ùå Monotone delivery (boring, disengaging)  
‚ùå "Upspeak" (ending statements like questions?)  
‚ùå Filler words (um, uh, like, you know)  
‚ùå Too fast (judges can't follow)  
‚ùå Too soft (judges can't hear)  
‚ùå Nervous voice crack (breathe, stay hydrated)

## ü§ù Team Coordination & Handoffs

### Seamless Transitions

**Handoff Script Template**:

**Member 1 ‚Üí Member 2**:
- Member 1: "Now that you understand our brand identity, [Member 2] will share the user research that informed these decisions."
- Member 2: "Thank you, [Member 1]. Through comprehensive user research..."
- **Physical**: Member 1 gestures toward Member 2, makes eye contact, then steps back

**Member 2 ‚Üí Member 3**:
- Member 2: "These insights shaped every design decision. [Member 3] will demonstrate how our prototypes bring this research to life."
- Member 3: "Thanks, [Member 2]. Let me walk you through our interactive prototypes..."

**Member 3 ‚Üí Member 4**:
- Member 3: "As you've seen, our prototypes create seamless experiences. [Member 4] will explain how this scales to impact the tournament's success."
- Member 4: "Thank you, [Member 3]. Our solution not only serves users today but scales for the future..."

### Visual Handoff Cues
- **Gesture**: Outgoing speaker gestures toward incoming speaker
- **Eye Contact**: Both speakers make brief eye contact
- **Movement**: Outgoing speaker steps back, incoming steps forward
- **Slide Advance**: New speaker advances to their first slide (visual cue)

### Timing Checkpoints

**Silent Signals** (Don't disrupt flow):
- **Timer Person** (designated role): Holds up fingers at:
  - 2:30 (Member 1 ‚Üí 2 transition)
  - 5:00 (Member 2 ‚Üí 3 transition)
  - 7:30 (Member 3 ‚Üí 4 transition)
  - 9:00 (1 minute warning)
  - 10:00 (Stop)

**Buffer Strategy**:
- Each speaker has 15-30 seconds of "expandable" content (can add or skip)
- If running ahead: Expand on examples, add extra detail
- If running behind: Skip optional examples, tighten language

## üí™ Confidence-Building Strategies

### Pre-Presentation Rituals

**60 Minutes Before**:
- Review speaker notes one final time
- Do vocal warm-ups (tongue twisters, scales)
- Practice power poses for 2 minutes (research-proven confidence boost)
- Team huddle: Positive affirmations and encouragement

**15 Minutes Before**:
- Bathroom break (always!)
- Sip water (hydration for voice)
- Deep breathing (4-7-8 technique: inhale 4, hold 7, exhale 8)
- Final tech check (slides load, clicker works)

**2 Minutes Before**:
- Stand in confident posture
- Shake out any tension
- Team fist bump or ritual
- Smile and take the stage

### Handling Nerves

**Physical Techniques**:
- **Breathing**: Slow, deep breaths activate calm response
- **Grounding**: Feel feet firmly on floor (stability)
- **Movement**: Channel energy into purposeful gestures
- **Micro-breaks**: Pause, breathe, continue (it's okay!)

**Mental Techniques**:
- **Reframe**: Nervousness = excitement (same physical response)
- **Focus**: Think about message, not yourself
- **Visualization**: Picture successful delivery (prime your brain)
- **Self-talk**: "I'm prepared. I know this material. I've got this."

## üéì Final Coaching Tips

### From Successful BPA Presenters

**"Practice until you can't get it wrong"** - Don't just practice until you get it right once. Practice until it's automatic.

**"Judges want you to succeed"** - They're not adversaries. They're educators evaluating your skills. Show them what you've learned.

**"Energy is contagious"** - Your enthusiasm for your project will make judges enthusiastic about your project.

**"Smooth handoffs = team coordination points"** - The transitions between speakers score as much as individual sections.

**"The first 30 seconds set the tone"** - Start strong, and you'll stay strong.
